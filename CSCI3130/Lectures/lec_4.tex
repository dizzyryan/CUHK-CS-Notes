\chapter{Regular Language}
\section{Regular Expression}
We describe regular language using basic language operations. it involves combination of strings of stmbols from some alphabet \(\Sigma\), parentheses and opertors. 

\begin{remark}
  regular expression is not a languaem but describption of language. 
\end{remark}

all finite languages can be described by regular expressionss. 

\begin{definition}
  Let \(\Sigma\) be agiven alphabet. then

  1. \(\varnothing, \lambda, a \in \Sigma\) are all regular expressionss, tgese are claled oprimitive regular expressions. 

  2. if \(r_1, r_2\) ar regular expressions, so are \(r_1 + r_2, r_1 \cdot r_2, r_1^{\star}, (r_1)\). 

  3. A string is a regular expression iff it can be derived from the primitive regular expressions by a finite number of applications of the rules in (2).
\end{definition}



Here denote \(L(R)\) the alnguae of regular expression \(R\).
