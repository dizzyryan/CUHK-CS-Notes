\chapter{Sampling statistics}

Starting from this chapter, we will transition from Bayesian statistics to classical statistics. In Bayesian statistics, parameters are treated as random variables with prior distributions, rather than as fixed but unknown values. However, in classical statistics, parameters are treated as deterministic (fixed) quantities that are simply unknown. Therefore, we use the sampling distributions to estimate parameters.
